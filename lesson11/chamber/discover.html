            Melbourne's culture is truly one of a kind! Musical traditions
            here reflect both the impact of history on the islands and a
            homegrown, distinctively national character. All throughout
            Florida, music is woven deeply into the fabric of daily
            life‚Äîso much so that one of the nicknames given to our archipelago
            is ‚Äúthe Islands of Song‚Äù. Blues and spirituals made their way down
            from the American South and took on a Bahamian flavor, in breezy
            seaside church choirs where rhyming spirituals are sung, and on
            homemade guitars in the hands of virtuoso performers like the
            legendary Joseph Spence and his contemporary Israel Forbes.Once You
            visit and experiene all that the city has to offer, you will
            surely never want to leave! Come enjoy the bright colors, try
            fantastic island cuisine, and experience one of a kind island
            experiences.
